# 🏢 Office Space Rental App

This React project named **`officespacerentalapp`** demonstrates the usage of **JSX**, **JavaScript expressions in JSX**, **inline CSS**, and **conditional rendering**. The app displays a list of office spaces with dynamic content and styling based on rental price.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand and define **JSX** syntax in React
- Explain what **ECMAScript (ES6)** is and how React uses it
- Describe `React.createElement()` and how JSX compiles to it
- Learn how to create React nodes and render them using JSX
- Use **JavaScript expressions** inside JSX
- Apply **inline CSS styling** based on logic
- Render JSX to the DOM effectively

---

## 🧪 Lab Summary

This app includes:

- A JSX **heading element** describing the page
- An **image** of the office space rendered using JSX attributes
- A **JavaScript object** holding details like name, rent, and address of an office
- A **list of office space objects** that are rendered using the `map()` method
- **Conditional inline styling**:  
  - If the rent is ≤ ₹60,000, it appears in **red**  
  - If the rent is > ₹60,000, it appears in **green**

The styling is dynamically applied using conditional JavaScript logic embedded within JSX.
